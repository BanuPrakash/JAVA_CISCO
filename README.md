========================================

OOP with Java.

OOP: Object Oriented Programming / Paradigm

Writing programs which resemble real world.

Tv/ AC / Fan / Bulb / Computer ,,,, are examples of real world objects.

Object: has state and behaviour
State example for TV: on/off, channel, volume, brightness, ... 
Behaviour: Switch On/off, changeChannel, Increase or decrease volume/brightness

Bulb:
State: on/off, brightness
Behaviour: switch on/off

Banking Account is also an object
State: balance
behaviour: credit/debit/check

Once we know what should be the state and behaviour of object we need templates to create them,
In software we use different programming languages to create templates:

```
1) C++ / Java / C# / TypeScript --> class as template

class BankingAccount {
    double balance;

    credit(amt) {}
    debit(amt) {}
}

2) JS --> function as template

function BankingAccount() {
    this.balance;
}

BankingAccount.prototype.credit = function(amt) {}

```
Abstraction:
We use interfaces to send messages to objects. User of object just needs to know what the message/behaviour/action does without worrying about how it does.

SOLID Design Principles has to be followed for good OOP.

S --> Single Resposibility Principle
O --> Open Close Principle
    Closed for Change, open for extention
L -> Liskov Substitution Principle.
At any point of time a specialized object should be able to replace a generaized object and get the work done.
Generalization and Specialization relationship
Account is generalized
SavingsAccount, LoanAccount, CurrentAccount. RDAccount are also specialized accounts

Account:
    login() and logout()

I should be able to login() and logout() using SavingsAccount / LoanAccount ... also

If we add credit() and debit() in account, this fails LSP, Why?
SavingsAccount can credit() and debit() but not with LoanAccount [ fails]

I --> Interface segregation
Banking Service has credit(), debit(), checkBalance(), createAccount(), lockAccount(), seeAllTransactions(), ....

If we login as Customer we get CustomerInterface which gives me only credit(), debit(), checkBalance()

If Admin logs in he gets AdminInterface using which he/she can createAccount(), lockAccount(), seeAllTransactions(), [different Remote]

D --> Dependency Injection
Inversion of Control

Flow:
Application ==> Presentation ==> Business Logic ==> Data Access Object ===> database

Normally we create Presentation object in Application, ... establish database connection in DAO layer
class Presentation {
    BusinessLogic logic = new BusinessLogic();
}

class DAO {
    Connection con = new Connection();
}

With DI, the flow is reveresed
Application <== Presentation <= Business Logic <== Data Access Object <=== database

=======

What is Java?
Java is a technology. It provides a platform which has JRE [Java Runtime environment] to execute bytecode.

What is bytecode? Compiled code like obj of C language.

How to generate a bytecode?
we need Development kits for that.
1) JDK --> Java Development kit which uses Java as programming language
JDK provides compiler to convert java code to bytecode
2) KDK --> kotlin development kit which use Kotlin as programming language
KDK provides compiler to covert kotlin to bytecode
3) Groovy ...

===========================================================
Data types:
Integeral types
byte -- 1 byte
short -- 2 bytes
int --> 4 bytes 
long --> 8 bytes

float --> 4 bytes
double --> 8 bytes

char --> 2 bytes of UNICODE character set [ ASCII is 1 byte]

boolean --> 1 byte [ true or false]

Java as programming language:

```
Account.java
public class Account {
    private double balance; // state of object

    // behaviour / action / message
    public void deposit(double amt) {
        this.balance += amt;
    }

    // behaviour / action / message
    public double getBalance() {
        return this.balance;
    }
}

```

JDK comes with compiler:
javac Account.java ===> Account.class [ bytecode]

bytecode is platform independent and architecture neutral


```
AccountExample.java

public class AccountExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Account rahulAcc = new Account();
        Account swethaAcc = new Account();

        rahulAcc.deposit(4000);
        swethaAcc.deposit(5000);

        System.out.println(rahulAcc.getBalance());
    }
}

```

javac AccountExample.java --> AccountExample.class [bytecode]

=============

to start JavaRuntime Environment [JRE]
java AccountExample

set CLASSPATH= .;c:\temp;d:\lib;d:\projects\lib;

new keyword is for dynamic memory allocation, like malloc / calloc of C programming
memory is allocated on HEAP area

tv.on(); here tv is the context
ac.on(); context here AC

context.message(arguments);

tv.changeChannel(454); 
tv.setVolume(45);

deposit(swethaAcc, 5000);

getBalance(rahulAcc);

=================================

Logically grouping of objects/classes in enterprise application
1) entity classes 
they represent business data. data which is long lived, generally survives the application crash. they have storage like database, redis, files, ...

Example for Uber:
Customer, Vehicle, Driver, Trip, Payment,,, 

Example for Amazon:
Customer, Product, Seller, Order, LineItem, Payment, ...

Most of the time these classes contains state, constructors, accessor, mutation code. No business logic inside this

https://www.database-answers.com/data_models/


Example:
```
    public class Customer {
        private String email; // state
        private String password; // state
        private String firstName;  // state
        
        //mutation
        public void setPassword(String pwd) {
            this.password = pwd;
        }
        
        //accessor
        public String getFirstName() {
            retutn this.firstName;
        }
    }

```

2) DAO: Data Access Objects
This contains code for CRUD operations [CREATE READ UPDATE and DELETE operations]

```
    public class CustomerDao {
        public void register(Customer c) {
            INSERT INTO customers table ....
        }

        public boolean login(Customer c) {
            select email and password from database table ...
        }
    }

```

3) Service classes: acts as a facade over DAO and buisness logic
Also decide what needs to be exposed to the client...

```
    public class BankingService {
        // one method call from client
        public void transferFunds(Account fromAcc, Account toAcc, double amt) {
            // check balance in fromAcc
            // business check if customer is eligible to transfer ...
            // update toAcc
            // update fromAcc
            // insert into transaction table
            // send SMS
            // send EMAIL
        }
    }

```

4) Utility classes: helper classes
5) Client classes: Android / Web based / Console based ...
6) Exception classes ...

===============

In java we use packages to logically group classes.
Packages are nothing but a folders

=====

In IDEs build is enabled by default which does the job of "javac"

state / instance variable are created for every object in heap area

visiblity mode:
1) private : visible only for class members
2) public: visible every where, inside the current class as well as classes present in other packages also.
3) default [package private]: [no access modifier specifed] visible to all classes within the same package. Not visible outside of package
4) protected: ...

=============

Constructors:
1) sort of special methods which has same name as that of class
2) no explict return type
3) they are invoked as soon as the object is created.
4) We can't explictly call the constructor
5) constructors can be overloaded [ more than one]
6) main purpose of constructor is used to initialize an object
7) Compiler creates default constructor if we don't write any.
If we write our own constructor then it's our responsibility to provide default also
Call a carpenter and ask him you need a Computer table [ he uses default values --> default constructor]

Give Carpepter the dimensions [ 4x2x3] --> parametrized constructor

Show him existing table and ask him to make a replica --> Copy constructor [ avoid in Java]

==================

static members, relationship between objects.


We need a member to keep track of how many instance s of Account exist?

static variable: class member, all objects of the given class share the memory [ metaspace]
instance variables: object members, each object will have a member in heap area

static methods: use class to invoke
instance method: use object context to invoke.
